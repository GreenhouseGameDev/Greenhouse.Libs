# Serialization
This is a serialization library inspired by Mojang's DataFixerUpper library, specifically the serialization package.
This mainly differs by having a far more simplistic and C# friendly implementation in comparison to their library.

## Special Thanks To...
- EdwinMindcraft - A lot of the original code was based off their C# Serialization library. I don't think I would've learnt a lot of the things I learnt so quickly without Edwin's implementation.
- Oliver-makes-code - Simplifying the whole thing.
